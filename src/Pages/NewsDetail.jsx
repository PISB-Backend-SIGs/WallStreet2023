            Shares of Credit Suisse on Wednesday plunged to a fresh all-time low
            for the second consecutive day after a top investor in the embattled
            Swiss bank said it would not be able to provide any more cash due to
            regulatory restrictions. Trading in the bankâ€™s plummeting stock was
            halted several times throughout the morning as it fell below 2 Swiss
            francs ($2.17) for the first time. Swiss-listed Credit Suisse shares
            ended the session down 24%, paring some of its earlier losses after
            dropping more than 30% at one point. The U.S.-traded American
            depositary receipts of Credit Suisse were last down about 15%. After
            European markets closed, Swiss regulators said that Credit Suisse
            currently meets capital and liquidity requirements and that the
            Swiss National Bank will provide additional liquidity if necessary.
